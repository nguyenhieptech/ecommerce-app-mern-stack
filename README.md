## ES Modules in Nodejs
---
ECMAScript Modules are used in the backend. Be sure to have at least `Node v14.6+` or you will need to add the `--experimental-modules` flag.

Also, when importing a file (not a package), be sure to add .js at the end or you will get a `module not found` error

You can also install and setup Babel if you would like.


# Run the project in your local machine

‚ùóÔ∏è **Notes: Follow step by step in order to not run to any errors.**

‚ùóÔ∏è **This project also has a lot of BUGS. Just mess around with the code in your local machine to find out more. Feel free to fix and contact me if you can.**
Example: Admin can delete himself, etc.

## Environment Variables
---
Create a .env file in the root and add the following variables. Add MongoDB URI and Paypal Client ID.

```
NODE_ENV = development
PORT = 5000
MONGO_URI = *mongodb uri*
JWT_SECRET = 'abc123'
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID = *paypal client id*
```

## Install Dependencies
---
`yarn` is being used in this project. You might not be able to setup the project with `npm`. Download [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable) here: https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable

When in the root folder, run these commands in command line to install all needed dependencies (packages). 

```
yarn install
```

Change directory in cmd to frontend folder, then run the same command to install all needed packages.
```
cd frontend
yarn install
```

## Create Sample Data in Database
---
Firstly, you should create some initial data to work first. You can use the following commands in `command line` to create the database with some sample users and products.

Import data
```
yarn run data:import
```

Sample User Logins. You're able to CHANGE both initial users and products for data seeding in `backend/data` folder. Check it for more details.
```
admin@gmail.com (Admin)
123456

user1@gmail.com (Customer)
123456

user2@gmail.com (Customer)
123456
```

‚ùóÔ∏è ***Notes: You're able to destroy all data. Using it carefully***

Destroy all data
```
yarn run data:destroy
```

## Start the project
---
Using `concurrently` package can help us to run both frontend (React) and backend (Express) with just one command. As you might know, they run in two different servers, or localhost.

Guide: https://www.rockyourcode.com/javascript-development-run-concurrently/

Run front-end (3000) & back-end (5000)

```
yarn run dev
```

Run backend only
```
yarn run server
```

If you have any problems with this `concurrently` package, just uninstall and install it again, it might work well.
